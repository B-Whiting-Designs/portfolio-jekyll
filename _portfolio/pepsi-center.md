tagline: No crystal pepsi here

intro: Pepsi Center is the stable of the sporting events in Denver, CO. Home to the Denver Nuggets and many different events, it was in need of an update. The design was a bit stale and looked a bit outdated.

header_1: website update and modernistic

header_1_content: I wanted to push the limit of the design starting with the header from the very beginning. I focused on making the colors of Pepsi standout for the entire design. Showcasing of the events and having filtered letter designs and showing levels makes it modern and gives attention. This was one of my first few design challenges and also featured in an article from <a href="https://www.attentioninsight.com/why-good-design-matters/bringing-attention-to-the-small-details/" class="red">Attention Insight</a>.
