tagline: Community Development Project

intro: Consuelo Bradley of Elite Event Planning came to me with a project in mind to help with using the community for gathering together and making a change. She wanted to make a way to help with giving people a new norm in Montgomery, AL that lets them enjoy their life with the pandemic going on right now.

header_1: A nice retouch

header_1_content: So this project was a new one and first of year for me in 2021 that I worked on. The website needed a retouch to their old design and update for a modern platform and viewing. So this was a nice simple change to the layout and structure with simple tones and changes used. This project used Weebly as the builder for it instead of my normal route of Netlify CMS or Cloud Cannon. It took about a week to get it finished and updated for the overall look and feel it has now.
