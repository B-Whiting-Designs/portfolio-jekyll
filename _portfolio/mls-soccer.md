tagline: Bring soccer into a modern era

intro: MLS - Major League Soccer (GO Atlanta United) - has been around for some time with their design. I saw the website after I was in need of a design challenge. The task at hand I set forth was to improve the design but not take away from the heavy use of images they use throughout their site. This site design was only a mockup of the website that I wanted to proposition as a change for the organization.
