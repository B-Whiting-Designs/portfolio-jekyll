tagline: Updating a modern site for growth

intro: Professional Restoration is a local restoration company based in Denver, CO with over 25 years of experience. They came looking for a new design to their old brand and gain digital pressence more. While working with my old agency I was able to help with their goal by redesign of the current site and new branding.

header_1: last project of NR

header_1_content: This was my last project for NR that I worked on at the time. I made this design in mind of their prior website that was a bit modern as it was with the use of their transition effects they used. They had a sticky footer but it was at times causing problems with scrolling when testing it out at times. I moved that to be a regular footer at the bottom and expanded their content to help with SEO on their site. We expanded content with more information to shell out what they do specifically and their background in the business. Adding a pop-up button for the header was useful to help with conversion rates overall on their site with getting more customers.

header_2: large increase of digital footprint

header_2_content: The update of the website was a large improvement for them. We made the site with WordPress as the CMS of choice for this one. The new site was a nice increase and improvement for the SEO that was a growth in 3 months time with an increase by 15% and conversion rating with the implementation of Google Ads that we setup for them. This was a true showcase that making a site update with content, design, and SEO optimization was a great and needed change.
