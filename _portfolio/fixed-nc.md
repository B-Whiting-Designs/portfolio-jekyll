tagline: Restoration with upscale design

intro: Fixed NC is a North Carolina restoration company that was established in 2018. They have over 30 years of staffing experience combined. A restoration company that wanted to get a restoration of their website design. The original focus on my design was to give it a whitespace and use of background layers behind the images.

header_1: first bit of my own style injected

header_1_content: I started with a simple change in a design and implanted my own version of it inside. The use of rounded borders made it a bit welcoming to me and the touch of the faded green behind the images was a nice change to get it modern. A box shadow around the box was meant to be there for helping show an effect when it is hovered over. I also helped with writing the code behind the layered box effect with the images and the content boxes using the psuedo ::before and ::after styles. A challenge but was fun to make it so it can be coded and responsive instead of an image each time.

header_2: restoration with upscale design

header_2_content: Update of their old site was easy to do as it was a small scale site that was in need of a change. Making a unified site structure was an improvement overall for their design. With a unified structure it helped with user interaction and increase in traffic and calls to their business locally for work. I say that was a job well done in my book, if I do say so myself.
