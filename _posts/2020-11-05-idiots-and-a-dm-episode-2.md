The crew has managed to get past a skeleton, a mutated beast, a mimic, and a few rats. Survived a Hydra that nearly killed the Orc and down to 3 party members from the first session that could play. This episode they are coming back from a long rest and must find a way to get out of the dungeon with their bodies in one and get their adventures guild license so they can make money. Will they break down and fail or triumph over it all?!

P.S. The other players aren't dead - they just are not able to play for this session

Listed below are the people involved in this episode and their characters they are playing:

- Dungeon Master, your Dungeon Pop - Rurk
- The Vengeful Paladin (Paladin/Warlock) Sakis - Brian
- The Blood Assassin (Blood Hunter/Rouge) Crorkiox - Tray
- The Brute (Barbarian/Fighter) Pa-gog Tukor - Zach

- Episode edited by Brian
- Music by various artists:
  - Tabletop Audio

So this is the first podcast brought to you by the Idiots and a DM crew. We are doing this podcast as a way of sharing our experience of a newbie dungeon and dragons group. Well not all the way tho, 2 of us have played it before in various sessions. This episode will be the first of many to come - hopefully.

The audio quality is a bit bad for many of us due to it being last minute and we all are doing it remote with either our phones' or laptops while the DM has his top of the line products. So bare with us during this moment. Our first journey starts in a town and earns our licenses to be adventures.
