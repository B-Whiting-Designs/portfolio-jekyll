The crew has managed to get past a skeleton, a mutated beast, a mimic, and a few rats. Survived a Hydra that nearly killed the Orc and down to 3 party members from the first session that could play. This episode they are coming back from a long rest and must find a way to get out of the dungeon with their bodies in one and get their adventures guild license so they can make money.
