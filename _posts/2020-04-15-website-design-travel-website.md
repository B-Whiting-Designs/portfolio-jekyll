  Recently I made a design for a contest on 99designs for a Travel Agency
  website. It was done in Adobe XD but didn't make the final cut. Back to the
  drawing board again guys.

I have been working lately on doing contests in my spare time when not working on websites for the recent nonprofits that I am working on. I took myself over to my original design site I started looking for work on [99designs](www.99designs.com){: target="_blank"} and found a contest for a travel agency website that wanted ideas.

I made a travel agency website before some months back while working with an agency and wanted to update it design for a more modern audience this time around. So I found this contest on the website and thought to myself, why not make this website redesign and get my feet wet a little right?

So here is the original website design that I had made a while back as a redesign mockup for a local travel agency in Denver, CO.

I saw that some flaws were there in the design such as the following:

* The header image was a bit too oversized and could use a more subtle tone
* The whitespace was nice but might need to be better when it comes to the overall feel of the website
* The font was a bit too much with the colors - the colors were tropical and had a nice colorful vibe but not for something simple
* Because of the images it was a bit too overbearing and could use a bit of a pull back for the text to takeover at times

So I took to the drawing board and came up with some new ideas for the contest I wanted to try and made it a bit more subtle and worked with the words. The best parts of it was the use of the interactive features I placed into it with the use of Adobe XD. It was hard before with Photoshop as I had to say what things would do, but with XD I am now able to show how I want the site to operate to a client ahead of time to give an easier view (the inner design and dev geek in me came out there).

So I didn't really make it to the final round with my design but that doesn't mean it is not a liked website design. So I will be making this as a template in HTML and Jekyll later if anyone would like to use it for their own project.

In the meantime, you can view the full interactive demo of the homepage [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/13e166b7-28f6-4b11-5288-1361ce26414f-65d0/?fullscreen){: target="_blank"}.
