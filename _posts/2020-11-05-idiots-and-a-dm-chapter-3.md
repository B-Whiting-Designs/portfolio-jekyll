With falling down to only 3 members left in their party with Bloodfiend and Pyria going about their own adventures and the end of Pa-gog Tukor due to an underground fight club, what is the party to do now?! Well look for new recruits that's what. And what better place to start than the actual Adventure's Guild tavern. Their they will meet an old Cleric that loves to make witty remarks and an unusual wizard that loves to be his own person.
