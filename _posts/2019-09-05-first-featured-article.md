<small>*This post is not a paid advertised post*</small>

So I was asked a month and half ago by [Attention Insight](https://www.attentioninsight.com/){: target="_blank"} for an interview for an article they wanted to write about designers to give them notice. At first, I thought it was a prank or scam due to the multiple amount of messages that I get in my spam filter, yet this was not one of them.

I was honored and appreciated to be apart of the post they wanted to make involving me and I was happy to give my input. This was my first featured article from another company to showcase my talent and work.
