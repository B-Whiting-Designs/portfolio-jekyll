So I have been gone from posting for a while now, it has been a minute I know. I have been looking into different platforms so that I can easily bring over my design style and code to my blog to match the feel of the homepage and I decided to work out doing so with Jekyll. The process will be a long one but it will be a change soon and will have the site look and feel as if it is apart of the entire site like before.

See you soon and can't wait to show it off to you guys!
