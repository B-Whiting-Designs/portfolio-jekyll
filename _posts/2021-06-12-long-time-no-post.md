  So it's been a minute since I have posted anything on my blog for a while and now I think it is time for me to do some updates for everyone and bring back some ideas for you.

So it has been a minute since I actually made a post on my blog for you guys. So far I had recently went through major car accident therapy and trying to get back to myself. But also in doing so I made some new projects that I started working on.

So working on the podcast has been a bit behind due to the injury as well, but gradually I am working on getting back to making the edits as I can, while still going through the recovery process.

While hurt, I have been making some flyers occasionally for a non-profit that I worked with before by the name of Art Transforms Inc. to help with their Zoom Meetings and big announcements in the city. But eventually I will get back to making my websites and providing templates and some resources for others to use soon.
