### Chapter 1: Hidden Flames

This is a tale, told like many others with the feeling of journey, adventure, and wonder of a young warrior starting on his own path to become the best warrior that he can become. Yet, it is also a story that is a bit different than that of those others because it also gives a look into his normal life outside of the adventures and the wonders that he sees. This my wonderful readers is the story of **Sakis Sarugi**, the *Godslayer* - well not yet that is.
