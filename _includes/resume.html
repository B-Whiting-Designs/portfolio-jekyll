                            <p>I started working as a freelancer since middle school when I was getting my feet wet. I only was able to make websites using Notepad in basic HTML and inline CSS. Worked with over 20 different projects during my time on and off as a freelancer. While working, I dabbled in Ruby, custom video game coding languages such as Eclipse and Gen2D (SandScript), and occasional WordPress. Lately has transitioned to JekyllRB for easier and faster development process.</p>
