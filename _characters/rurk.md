He is your Dungeon Daddy, master or your fate, and the bringer of your pain. He made this journey that you are listening to and making you feel as if they have a chance but secretly they do not. A DM that has been doing his passion and crafting it for over 9 years in the making. He is basically Sephiroth to Sakis but also his Zack at times. Humble, but a perfect embodiment of Aku voice and talent. Should be in voice acting for his talented drunk/aggressive dwarf (also adult baby) voices that he can do.
