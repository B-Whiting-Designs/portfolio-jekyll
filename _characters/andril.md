level: '5'
age: '20'
race: Eladrin
weapon: |

  Training the typical route of learning how to use the longsword and shield combo. Sacrificing the ability for damage to have the ability to protect those around him. He is the epitome of a meat shie...I mean tank for the group.

armor: |

  Favouring the ability to be mobile while also tanking the brunt force of a hit, he uses chain mail to be able to make that happen.

gear: |

  He keeps close to him his Paladin emblem as his focus and concentration of what he has to do. Now as part of the Adventures Guild to focus on his past and become a protector, he keeps the patch on his person as well.

After he has joined and is gazing upon a quest board he is approached by a small group of adventures. The adventures and he join forces and begin a new adventure as Andril hopes to uncover events of his past while traveling with the group.
