Laredo grew up in an enormous lighthouse at the edge of a stormy sea. To its residents, it served more as a temple to the elven storm goddess Aerdrie Faenya. The elves he lived amongst spent centuries becoming powerful clerics, centuries he as only half an elf did not have. Having grown frustrated with their treatment of him as a youth, he plead for guidance from Aerdrie - and was granted an audience with her! She said that she saw in him a great natural talent for stormy magic, and that he must leave the lighthouse for adventure if he wanted to find fulfillment in life. And so he did just that. He journeyed out to join the Elysium Adventurers Guild, determined to forge his own path, and confident that a healthy balance of chaos and fate would guide him to greatness.
