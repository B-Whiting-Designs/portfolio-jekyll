Wondering the world in search of something that even he doesn't know. A believer that through battle and adventure he can find the purpose of his life. He left his mercenary guild of the Gruul, that favored fighting and the love of a battle to be a member of a adventure guild so that he can find his purpose. Found defending himself against a group of trolls in a storm like an old timey kung-fu movie and joining the party after thinking that he could face a dragon alone.
