header_1: Highlights

header_1_content: This episode was a true test of editing for me. I decided to up the anty and add in more sound effects for the fights and roleplay scenes. So far this was my most trying one but also fun one to edit. Even Rurk went into this with being detailed and making the game even more interactive storywise for us.
