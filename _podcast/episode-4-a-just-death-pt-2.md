tagline: Fight Club Creed

intro: We bring it back to the fight club, but this time it is a full free for all! The Orc has gone through watching the fight and deciding to jump into the fray himself. We also finally meet up with one of the new members of the group, Andril the Eladrin Paladin with a mysterious past. Let's see what unfolds for the group as they have now found out they are being used as a means to gain business.

header_1: Highlights

header_1_content: This episode was a true test of editing for me. I decided to up the anty and add in more sound effects for the fights and roleplay scenes. So far this was my most trying one but also fun one to edit. Even Rurk went into this with being detailed and making the game even more interactive storywise for us.
